This repository holds a number of AtomECS simulations which have been written to run in browser.
[bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) is used to perform 3D rendering of the simulations, and the simulations are compiled to web assembly by GitHub Actions.

The output can be seen [here](https://teamatomecs.github.io/AtomECSDemos/).
