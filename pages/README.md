## Technical details

This repository holds a number of [AtomECS](https://github.com/TeamAtomECS/AtomECS) simulations which have been written to run in browser.
[bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) is used to perform 3D rendering of the simulations, and the simulations are compiled to web assembly using GitHub CI and served through GitHub pages.

These AtomECS demos are currently maintained by Elliot Bentine.
